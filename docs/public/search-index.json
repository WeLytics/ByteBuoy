The YAML reader heavily relies on reflection, and the code trimming feature, which removes unused code, can lead to issues by inadvertently removing necessary code paths that the YAML reader depends on.\nSolution: To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:\nDisable the Trim Code Option: Navigate to your build configuration settings and locate the Trim Code option. Ensure that this option is deactivated or turned off.\nRebuild the Agent: After disabling the Trim Code option, rebuild the ByteBuoy.Agent.\nRun the Agent Again: With the Trim Code option disabled, run the ByteBuoy.Agent once more. The error should no longer occur, and the Agent should function as expected.\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully troubleshoot and resolve the build error encountered with ByteBuoy.Agent.\n","date":"2023-09-07","id":4,"permalink":"/docs/build-notes/","summary":"Troubleshooting Builds: ByteBuoy.Agent Error Issue: When attempting to run the ByteBuoy.Agent, you encounter the following error message:\nError reading config: Line: 1, Col: 1, Idx: 0Failed to create an instance of type 'ByteBuoy.","tags":[],"title":"Build Notes"},{"content":"Adding a Database Migration To add a new database migration, please run the script src\\addMigration.cmd.
